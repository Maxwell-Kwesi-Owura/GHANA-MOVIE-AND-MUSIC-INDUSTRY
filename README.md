# Project Overview: Understanding Success in Ghanaâ€™s Entertainment Industry
This project investigates what drives success among Ghanaian celebrities in music and film. Focusing on 30 public figures, we analyzed revenue, awards, professional diversity, gender, and geographic representation to uncover key patterns.
Using SQL, we built structured tables to organize data on songs, movies, roles, and recognition. Then, with Power BI, we created an interactive dashboard to visualize insights.

# ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

* Analyze success factors in Ghanaâ€™s entertainment industry using data from 30 celebrities in music and film.

* Investigate revenue generation across professions, genres, and song languages.

* Examine patterns in recognition through awards and professional diversity.

* Use SQL to structure and query data efficiently.

* Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize insights and trends.

* Provide actionable, data-driven insights to understand what drives fame and financial success.

# Data Source

The dataset was created through research on various Ghanaian celebrities across the music and film industries. Using SQL, we populated and structured the dataset by extracting relevant information such as:

* Number of awards won

* Gender distribution

* Profession (musicians, actors, and others)

* Revenue generated

* Movies and songs produced

# Tools Used

* SQL â€“ for dataset creation, querying, and structuring.

* Power BI â€“ for initial data cleaning and formatting and building interactive dashboards and visualizations.

# Types of Analysis Used

* Descriptive Analysis â€“ summarizing the distribution of awards, gender, and professions.

* Comparative Analysis â€“ comparing musicians vs actors in terms of revenue and awards.

* Categorical Analysis â€“ analyzing distribution of awards across categories.

* Geographical Analysis â€“ identifying celebrity counts by location.

  # Insights

* Music dominates Ghanaâ€™s entertainment landscape in terms of revenue, awards, and output.

* Sarkodie and Stonebwoy are the most recognized awardees, reinforcing musicâ€™s dominance.

* Gender gap exists both in award distribution and celebrity representation, with men leading significantly.

* Accra serves as the hub of celebrity activity, hosting the majority of personalities.

 # Recommendations

* Encourage female participation in the industry through mentorship programs and initiatives to close the gender gap.

* Promote diversity in award recognition by creating more categories for emerging talents.

* Leverage the music industryâ€™s strength to drive international collaborations and boost revenue.

* Develop regional talent hubs outside Accra (e.g., Kumasi, Takoradi) to decentralize opportunities.

* Support film industry growth through targeted investments and collaborations to balance industry recognition with music.
